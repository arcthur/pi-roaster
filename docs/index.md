# Documentation Index

This repository uses a layered documentation system:

- `guide`: how to use and operate the system
- `reference`: stable contracts and technical surfaces
- `journeys`: end-to-end workflows across subsystems
- `troubleshooting`: failure patterns and remediation
- `research`: design notes and roadmap context
